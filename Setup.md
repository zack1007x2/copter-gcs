On the main page there are several options to configure:


**Select Protocol**

Select either MAVLink or AC1

**Select Link**

Currently just Bluetooth, but enables USB (once USB-Serial is supported by Android) or WIFI (Once I have a module that would need it).

**Lock Orientation**

For people using a tablet, this lets you force a certain orientation for all views.
Options are Portrait, Landscape, or "App Recommended" which lets the app decide for each view.

**Forget Defaults**

Clears the parameters, next load will request to set options again.
The Bluetooth modem is also forgotten
