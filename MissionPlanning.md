# Notes #

  * This activity has not been tested, other than to make sure that the mission loads on the DIYDrones Mission planner.
  * Parameters are not verified, and no guidance is (currently) given for setting up the waypoints.
  * Altitude is not set, defaulting to either 0, or the previous waypoint's altitude.
